The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

A quick
 ls
reveals that the sshkey.private is conveniently stored in our home directory.
Using OpenSSH with the -i option in order to submit an identity file, we can log in as bandit14
  ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private
now we're logged in and have permissions to read the password file for bandit14

  cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
returns the password for bandit14 / 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
