The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed
For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir.
For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Ugh. This.

First, due to directory permissions, etc. we need to copy the file to a folder we create in the tmp directory so we can manipulate data.txt multiple times, creating new files in the process:
  mkdir /tmp/Wind3x
to make a directory in the /tmp directory

  cp data.txt /tmp/Wind3x
to make a copy of data.txt in the directory we just created

  cd /tmp/Wind3x
to navigate to our directory  

So let's start by reversing the hexdump with 'xxd' and the '-revert' option:
  xxd -r data.txt data1
  
  file data1
tells us our new file is gzip compressed data...in order to avoid suffix headaches with 'gunzip' I simply
  zcat data1 >> data2
  
  file data2
tells us our data2 file is bzip2 compressed data... rinse and repeat
  bzcat data2 >> data3
  file data3
is now gzip compressed data

  zcat data3 >> data4
  file data4
reveals "POSIX tar archive" and I believe most people will reccommend the -xvf options for extract, verbose, and file respectively

  tar -xvf data4
gives us data5.bin
  file data5.bin
reveals another tar archive
  tar -xvf data5.bin
gives us data6.bin
  file data6.bin
reveals another bzip2 compressed file

  bzcat data6.bin >> data7
  file data7
another tar archive

  tar -xvf data7
  file data8.bin
more gzip compressed data...

 zcat data8.bin >> data9
 file data9
ASCII text. Finally.

  cat data9
provides us the password to bandit13 / 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
