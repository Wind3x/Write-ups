The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

  man uniq
tells us that the 'uniq' command filters adjacent matching lines, therefore it is helpful to sort the file and pipe the output into the 'uniq' command with the -u option to only print unique lines.
  
  sort data.txt | uniq -u
gives us the password to bandit9 / UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR
