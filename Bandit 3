The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

I usually check to see what's in my current directory with ls, revealing the inhere directory.

First we switch directories with
  cd inhere

Another ls reveals nothing.

A quick list directories -all:
  ls -a
reveals the .hidden file

  cat .hidden
gives us the password for bandit4 / pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
