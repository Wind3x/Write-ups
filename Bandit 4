The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.
Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

If there were more files I might script this, however I just ran the "file" command on the individual files until I found the right one

  file ./-file07
reveals ASCII text as the file type
  cat ./-file07
gives us the password for bandit5 / koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh

Edit:

  for i in $(ls); do file -- $i; done

Gives us which file is ASCII text
Had to use -- to delimit the option list since the filenames start with -

"A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters used to specify the boundary between separate,
independent regions in plain text or other data streams. 
An example of a delimiter is the comma character, which acts as a field delimiter in a sequence of comma-separated values."
