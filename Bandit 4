The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.
Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

If there were more files I might script this, however I just ran the "file" command on the individual files until I found the right one

  file ./-file07
reveals ASCII text as the file type
  cat ./-file07
gives us the password for bandit5 / koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
