The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties: 
human-readable - 1033 bytes in size - not executable

Using the find command with the -size option and tacking on a 'c' to the end of the expected size to specify bytes intead of block size
  find -size 1033c
gives us ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
  cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
gives us the password for bandit6 / DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
  
If you really wanted to verify the human-readable requirement you could run 'file' on the file revealing 'ASCII text'
