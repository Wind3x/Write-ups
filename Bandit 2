The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

You must either surround the filename in quotes or escape the spaces:

  cat "spaces in this filename"
OR
  cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
  
gives us the password for bandit3 / UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

But the easieset way is to use tab completion:
  cat sp[tab] should auto-complete this command for you, useful for many situations (stop typing your full filenames!)
